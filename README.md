### Build Instructions

#### Sensor Configuration
Login to the `RSP Controller` and set the `Personality` of a SINGLE sensor to `EXIT`. This is the sensor that will trigger recording events when a matching RFID tag moves near it.

#### Service Configuration
Modify the [`secrets/configuration.json`](secrets/configuration.json) with your camera and tag information

- `ipCameraStreamUrl` Stream URL for the IP Camera you wish to connect to. (Example: `"rtsp://user:pass@ipaddress:port"`)
- `epcFilter` Wildcard based filter of EPC tags to trigger on. (Example: `"3014*BEEF*"`)
- `skuFilter` Wildcard based filter of SKU/GTIN values to trigger on. (Example: `"123*78*"`)
- `emailSubscribers` String comma separated of emails to receive notifications. (Example: `"your@email.com,your@email2.com"`)

> **NOTE 1:** `skuFilter` and `epcFilter` must **BOTH** match for the tag to match. Typically you would set one or the other and then set the other field to match everything (`*`)

> **NOTE 2:** In regards to `skuFilter` and `epcFilter`, a value of `*` effectively matches every possible item. Also, the filter must match the whole EPC/SKU and not just a subset. For example, if the SKU value is `123456789`, a filter of `*345*`, `123*`, `*789`, `1*5*9` **WILL** match, however filters such as `1234`, `789`, `*8`, `12*56` will **NOT** match because they only match a *subset* of the SKU and not the whole value.

#### Build
Compile the Go source code, create the docker images, and start the docker swarm services

```bash
sudo make iterate
```

> The first time you run this it may take quite some time. Grab some :coffee:.


### Web Interface
The web interface is integrated with the Angular [`Demo UI`](http://localhost:4200/loss-prevention). 
It provides a way to view previous recordings including any people/objects detected. 
Recordings can also be deleted from the web ui.

### Application Flow
- Make REST calls to the `EdgeX Command Service` to retrieve information about the RSP sensors. 
  - The application needs to know which RSP sensors are `EXIT` personality, as well as the aliases for each RSP in order to perform lookups of `alias -> device_id`.   
- Subscribe to `ZeroMQ` to receive `inventory_event` messages from EdgeX CoreData
  - When an event is received, pass it on the the Trigger Logic to determine whether to trigger a recording.

### Trigger Logic
> **ALL** Of the following conditions **MUST** be met for the recording to trigger
- Event type is `moved`
- Previous location is **not** an `EXIT` personality sensor
- Current location **is** an `EXIT` personality sensor
- SKU matches `skuFilter` wildcard from [`secrets/configuration.json`](secrets/configuration.json) (`"*"` matches everything)
- EPC matches `epcFilter` wildcard from [`secrets/configuration.json`](secrets/configuration.json) (`"*"` matches everything)
- Another recording is not currently in progress

### Recordings
Video clips are stored to a docker volume mounted at `./recordings` and served
using an `nginx` docker container.

## Privacy Compliance
This software includes functionality which allows you to record video clips
to a persisted storage device and display them on a basic website. Due to the sensitive nature of
this data, it is imperative that you harden your installation in order
to protect yourselves from potential security and privacy concerns.

We have [some basic guidelines for you to follow](https://github.com/intel/rsp-sw-toolkit-im-suite-inventory-suite#hardening-your-installation), but ultimately it is up to **YOU** 
to protect your installation and data.
