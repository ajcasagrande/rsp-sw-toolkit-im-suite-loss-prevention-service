## Technical Details

### Docker build explanation
This project consists on 3 Dockerfiles and one docker compose file.

- [`Dockerfile.builder`](../Dockerfile.builder) is based on `Ubuntu 18.04` and consists of `Intel OpenVINO` _development_ packages, `Go` compiler, as well as various Debian packages needed to compile the source code. It is setup for build caching in order to speed up subsequent builds.
- [`Dockerfile.runtime`](../Dockerfile.runtime) is based on `Ubuntu 18.04` and consists of `Intel OpenVINO` _runtime_ packages, as well as various Debian packages needed for running the compiled application.
- [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) is based on the image generated by [`Dockerfile.runtime`](../Dockerfile.runtime). It combines the runtime image with the compiled Go binary and a few scripts and configuration files. This generates the final docker image that will be run by docker compose.

- [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) contains the service description and configuration for running the Loss Prevention Example App. It also contains an [`nginx`](../docker-compose.yml#L111-L124) service which hosts the static recorded files for use with the web interface.
